## Description 
My 'E-commmerce Website' application was created as a challenge for the MSU ED-X full stack bootcamp. My task was to create the API and Express.js as well as implementing Sequelize to be used with a MySQL database. 

In this application we have used the four model and model associations: GET, POST, PUT & DELETE routes.
